- [RachitCaster](https://github.com/rachitkakkar/RachitCaster) A retro-style raycaster written using HTML 5 Canvas and pure JavaScript. Features textures, a mini-map, procedural/maze generation, and more!
- [RachitBan](https://github.com/rachitkakkar/RachitBan): A Kanban board built with ReactJS. Designed as a learning project to learn the framework and get my foot in the door of web development as it is not something I have typically focused on.
- [resurgence_renderer](https://github.com/rachitkakkar/resurgence_renderer): A raytracer powered by python and pygame that produces beautiful results!
- [python](https://github.com/rachitkakkar/python): A collection of various python scripts I have made over the years.
