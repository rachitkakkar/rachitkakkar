# Rachit Kakkar
Hello, my name is Rachit Kakkar. I am a coder who has done a variety of projects both big and small. I see code as a tool, and I spend most of my time coding utilities to help me with my daily life. For example, I recently created a utility that removes all frames with hands from a video, to help me with stop motion :)! Another example is my most recent project is a terminal dasboard I am making to help me visualize my dividend stock portfolio!
