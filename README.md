# Projects
- [RachitBan](https://github.com/rachitkakkar/RachitBan): A Kanban board built with ReactJS. Designed as a learning project to learn the framework and get my foot in the door of web development as it is not something I have typically focused on.
- [resurgence_renderer](https://github.com/rachitkakkar/resurgence_renderer): A raytracer powered by python and pygame that produces beautiful results!
- [CroipeEngine](https://github.com/Croipe/CroipeEngine): A header only C++ 17 game engine implemented from scratch, allowing you to draw 3D Wireframe graphics directly to the command prompt, featuring the ability to lead .obj files, take input, and play audio.
